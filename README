chain_cover - Finds the minimum chain cover of a graph

I. Minimum Chain Cover:
        A. Finds the minimum chain cover of a given graph using exact methods.
        B. Parameter based random graph generation
        C. Finding and listing all reachable simple chains from a given vertex
        D. Cycle Detection
        E. Non recursive k-subset generation
        F. List all k vertex sets that are also chain covers
G. Specify graph as a text file for input

II. Running the program
        A. USAGE: Specify <rows> <columns> <vertex density> <edge connectivity>. All are mandatory.

III. General Naming Conventions:
        A. Only structures have capital first letter names
        B. All other identifiers have lowercase names with underscores for separators.
